# braziltrip

This project contains a small static website outlining a six day journey along the Cear√° coast of Brazil.

Open `index.html` for an overview map, quick day-by-day links and highlight photos. The detailed schedule lives in `itinerary.html` and top activities can be found on `highlights.html`.
